# Guitar-tuner-mobile-app-
A mobile application in Flutter for tuning guitar and other instruments. This was developed for an assignment for Computer-based Sound Production course. 

The aim of the assignment is to develop a mobile app for tuning different instrument. So far the app supports Ukulele and Guitar. The user can choose the way of tuning (for guitar standard tuning, drop D etc.). When tuning the instrument the user recieves feedback information in which way he should adjust the tone (tune up, tune down). 

The sound processing is done with the help of already developed libraries. 

The application is being tested in Android Studio Emulator for Android.
